Run Python in Google drive
The Google Colaboratory (“Colab”) is a notebook (like a Jupyter Notebook) where you can run Python code in your Google Drive. 
You can write text, write code, run that code, and see the output – all in line in the same notebook. 
Benefits of Google Colab
Sharing notebooks is as easy as sharing any Google document. You can also get the app and run the code from your phone.
You can use the powerful and popular Python language in your Google Drive, and the set-up will take less than five minutes. 
Because Python runs on a server (and not in your local browser or on your local computer) you can easily use it to interact with an online database and analyze data in situations where you need to keep the code private.
